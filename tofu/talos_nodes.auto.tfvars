# UPDATED Resource Allocation Summary:
# homelab (48GB): ctrl-00(6GB) + ctrl-01(6GB) + ctrl-02(6GB) = 18GB (38% - LOTS OF HEADROOM)
# nipogi (80GB): work-01(10GB) + work-02(10GB) + work-03(10GB) + work-04(10GB) + work-05(10GB) + work-06(10GB) = 60GB (75% - SAFE!)
# 
# Total: 78GB used of 128GB available (61% utilization)
# Strategy: NO WORKERS on homelab to prevent crashes, 6 workers on nipogi at safe RAM levels
# Benefits: homelab stability, safe nipogi resource usage, plenty of headroom
