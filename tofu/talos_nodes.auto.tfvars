# SAFE Resource Allocation Summary:
# homelab (48GB): ctrl-00(6GB) + ctrl-01(6GB) + ctrl-02(6GB) + work-00(8GB) + work-02(8GB) = 34GB (71% - SAFE BUFFER)
# nipogi (80GB): work-01(12GB) + work-03(12GB) + work-04(12GB) + work-05(12GB) + work-06(12GB) = 60GB (75% - SAFE BUFFER)
# 
# Total: 94GB used of 128GB available (73% utilization)
# Strategy: Conservative allocation with safety buffers for etcd stability
# Benefits: 14GB buffer on homelab, 20GB buffer on nipogi, no risk of OOM kills
