# - cert-manager: Main controller (certificate requests, renewals)
# - cainjector: CA injection into resources
# - webhook: Validation webhook for cert resources
#
# üéØ WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
# - Track certificate expiry and renewal status
# - Monitor ACME challenge failures
# - Alert on certificate issuance errors
# - Track ClusterIssuer/Issuer health
