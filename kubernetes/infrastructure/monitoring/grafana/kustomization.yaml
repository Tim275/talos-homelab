# (These work with both Helm Grafana and Grafana Operator)
  - datasources.yaml              # Prometheus connection configuration
  - dashboards-configmap.yaml     # Complete dashboard JSON files as Infrastructure as Code
  - dashboards/                   # Folder with specialized dashboard collections

# ❌ REMOVED: Helm chart - replaced by Grafana Operator CRD
# helmCharts:
