# 🌊 Sync Wave 6: Grafana CRD Resources (After Grafana Operator Wave 4)
commonAnnotations:
  argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "6"

# 🎯 GRAFANA OPERATOR PATTERN - Only CRD resources, no Helm chart!
# Grafana Operator (deployed separately) manages the Grafana instance
resources:
  - grafana-instance.yaml         # ✅ REQUIRED - GrafanaDatasource needs matching Grafana instance
  - grafana-datasource.yaml       # ✅ CRITICAL - connects Grafana to Prometheus/Loki!

# 📊 ConfigMap Dashboards - keep your preferred dashboard pattern
# (These work with both Helm Grafana and Grafana Operator)
  - datasources.yaml              # Prometheus connection configuration
  - dashboards-configmap.yaml     # Complete dashboard JSON files as Infrastructure as Code
  - dashboards/                   # Folder with specialized dashboard collections

# 🎯 GRAFANA OPERATOR DASHBOARDS - Native GrafanaDashboard CRDs
# Enterprise-grade monitoring dashboards using Grafana Operator
  - operator-dashboards/          # Native GrafanaDashboard CRDs for all infrastructure components

# ❌ REMOVED: Helm chart - replaced by Grafana Operator CRD
# helmCharts:
#   - name: grafana
#     repo: https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
