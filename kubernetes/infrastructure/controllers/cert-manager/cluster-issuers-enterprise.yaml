# ENTERPRISE CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT
# Dual ClusterIssuer Setup following industry best practices
#
# Pattern used by: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, most SaaS companies
# - PRODUCTION issuer for ALL environments (dev + prod)
# - STAGING issuer ONLY for cert-manager troubleshooting and CI/CD testing
#
# Rate Limits (per domain):
# - Production: 50 certificates/week (sufficient for homelab)
# - Staging: Unlimited (for testing only)
