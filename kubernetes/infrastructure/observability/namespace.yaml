# 📋 NOTE: Namespaces elastic-system and opentelemetry are managed by the
# operators app (kubernetes/infrastructure/controllers/operators/namespaces.yaml)
# to avoid SharedResourceWarning conflicts in ArgoCD.
#
# The operators app deploys at sync-wave -1 BEFORE this app, ensuring
# namespaces exist when operator Helm charts are installed.
