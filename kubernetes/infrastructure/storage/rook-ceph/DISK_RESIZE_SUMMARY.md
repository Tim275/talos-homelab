## 📊 Capacity Achievement

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Total Capacity** | 322GB | 1.2TB | **3.7× increase** |
| **Available** | 253GB | 1.14TB | **4.5× increase** |
| **Usage** | 21% | 4.9% | **Much healthier** |

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Completed Successfully:**
1. ✅ **Terraform Disk Resize** - All VMs updated (50GB OS + 200GB Ceph per worker)
2. ✅ **VM Recreation** - ctrl-0, worker-1, worker-5 recreated successfully
3. ✅ **OSD Provisioning** - New OSD-6 (worker-1) and OSD-7 (worker-5) created
4. ✅ **PG Rebalancing** - 40% degraded → 0% (fully recovered)
5. ✅ **Ghost OSD Cleanup** - Old OSD-2/3 auto-removed from CRUSH map
6. ✅ **Cluster Stability** - All 7 nodes Ready, all apps running

### **Remaining (Non-Critical):**
⚠️ **MON_DISK_LOW** (mon b on worker-3)
- Current: 83% disk usage
- Impact: None (warning only, not critical until >90%)
- Fix: Requires worker-3 reboot (deferred to maintenance window)

⚠️ **SMALLER_PGP_NUM**
- Impact: None (cosmetic warning)
- Fix: Ceph autoscaler will auto-fix within 24h

## 🚀 Production Readiness

**Cluster Status: PRODUCTION READY** ✅

- ✅ All nodes healthy (7/7)
- ✅ All OSDs running (6/6)
- ✅ All critical apps running (ArgoCD, N8N, Elasticsearch, etc.)
- ✅ 1.14TB storage available (plenty of headroom!)
- ✅ Zero data loss
- ✅ Zero downtime for end users

**HEALTH_WARN Status:** Acceptable for production  
(Only minor non-critical warnings remaining)

---

## 📋 Future Maintenance Tasks

1. **Worker-3 Reboot** (Optional, low priority)
   - Schedule during next maintenance window
   - Will fix MON_DISK_LOW warning
   - No urgency (disk at 83%, not critical)

2. **Monitor Alerts**
   - Watch Prometheus for storage trends
   - Alert if Ceph >70% capacity

---

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

1. **Conservative Sizing Works** - 50GB OS + 200GB Ceph was perfect starting point
2. **Ceph Auto-Healing** - Let Ceph clean up ghost OSDs automatically
3. **VM Recreation Safe** - 3x replication survived 2 OSDs being recreated
4. **Talos Resilience** - Cluster stayed healthy throughout process
